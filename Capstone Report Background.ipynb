Introduction\n\n1.1 Background\nHome to some of the world's largest companies like Boeing and Microsoft, as well as cultural staples like Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, Seattle has established itself as one of the most prominent cities on the American west coast. In just the last forty years, the population has doubled to nearly 4 million people. Along with this tremendous growth arrived the various challenges that confront large cities, including the issue of traffic. As the 14th most congested city in the United States, Seattle requires its citizens to spend hundreds of hours each year on the road. It is imperative that Seatlleites feel safe while driving in their home city. \n\n1.2 Problem\nIn order to help create a safer driving environment in Seattle, drivers and local officials should be able to identify conditions and intersections with a greater incidence of severe accidents. By predicting the severity of accidents under different weather, visibility, and time conditions, Seattle's residents can avoid adverse conditions and reduce the likelihood of falling victim to a severe accident. In additions, drivers can exercise extra caution at intersections with particularly high accident rates.\n\n1.3 Interest\nAny resident of the Seattle Metropolitan area would benefit from this information, as it would allow them to identify the safest conditions and locations for driving. Public officials could also use this information to prepare for the likelihood of severe accidents given certain conditions and locations. Lastly, insurance companies could better predict the likelihood of a severe claim in areas that are more prone to adverse conditions (poor weather, low visibility, late-night driving.)"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "2. Data\n\n2.1 Data Sources\nThis project's dataset was gathered by the Seattle Police Department and Traffic Records Department since 2004 to identify factors that cause accidents. The dataset lists 65,534 accidents and 37 variables in those accidents. These variables can provide insight into the various factors that contribute to accidents in the Seattle area.\n\n2.2 Feature Selection\nI have selected features that provide information about specific driver conditions and intersections. 'ADDRTYPE' and 'LOCATION' were used to identify specific intersections.  'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND', 'LIGHTCOND', and 'INCDTTM' were used to identify weather, road conditions, light conditions, and time, respectively. Of course, 'SEVERITY CODE' would be included, as it is the dependent or target variable that is being predicted in this project.\n\n2.3 Data Cleaning\nAll the features not mentioned in the Feature Selection (2.2) section will be removed. Then, any accidents with a null value (among the remaining features) will be removed from the dataset. In doing so, the predictive model will have the necessary information to make predictions about the severity of an accident. In addition, the 'INCDTTM' column will be altered by removing any accidents without a timestamp and converting all timestamps into military time.
